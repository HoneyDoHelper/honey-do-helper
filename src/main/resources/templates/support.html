                        There may not be any Honeydoers in your area because there aren't many support requests from your area. Inform your friends about this awesome service and I am sure that they will also recommend it to service providers in your area. As the demand comes, Honeydo Helpers will come with the support.

                        Honeydoers can very well be licensed but it is not a requirement. Many of your Honeydoers are bringing years of personal experience at a fraction of the cost. We are merely linking those needing help with those both willing and able to provide it. As such, if your job requires a professional or a specific license, be sure to reach out to someone who meets your needs and even suggest that they register and become a HONEYDOER!

                        Of course you can. An HVAC professional is not a plumber, so he may need help in that area and a plumber oftentimes has no idea about masonry. We all have a role to play and can lean on one another. Allow your neighbors to help you trim down that Honey-Do List so there is more free time to spend with family.
